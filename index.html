    <p style="font-family: Arial;"> The terminal is the software application we use to interact with the console. Terminal is a command language interpreter - so it can interpret text commands (inputs) into various computer operations (outputs). The terminal is the place where we type texts (or commands) in our command line. The terminal is the place where we can talk directly to our computer with texts. <strong>Let's Learn Terminal</strong>.

   <h2 style="font-family: Arial;">About Neurodiversity</h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial;"> WHAT we do is just as important as HOW we accomplish it. Every person brings valuable insights and approaches to projects and problem-solving. Neurodiversity is a competitive advantage for companies and organizations, especially in tech. HOW you learn - can enhance your capacity to see and solve problems in ways that might-not come as easily to others. People with learning differences often adjust to cope with academic structures that are-not designed with disability in mind. The problem-solving skills people develop through managing unique learning styles can be advantageous to your career. Keep going! </p>
